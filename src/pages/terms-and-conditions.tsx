            submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will
            make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of
            reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow
            applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator
            fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable
            AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in
            United States, Utah. Except as otherwise provided herein, the
            Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay
            proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or
            enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
            <br />
            <br />
            If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than
            arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the
            state and federal courts located in United States, Utah, and the
            Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of
            personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to
            venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts. Application
            of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
            Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act
            (UCITA) are excluded from these Legal Terms.
            <br />
            <br />
            In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any
            way to the Services be commenced more than one (1) years after the
            cause of action arose. If this provision is found to be illegal or
            unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any
            Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be
            illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a
            court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for
            jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal
            jurisdiction of that court.

            The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the
            Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent
            permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other
            proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be
            arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action
            procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute
            to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of
            the general public or any other persons.

            arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or
            concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights
            of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations
            of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c)
            any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be
            illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate
            any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to
            be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a
            court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for
            jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal
